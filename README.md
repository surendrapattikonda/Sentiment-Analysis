# Sentiment Analysis on Beauty Product Reviews

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks for performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews of beauty products. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning and deep learning models.

## üìÅ Notebooks Included

- `Sentiment1.ipynb`: Initial exploration, preprocessing, and traditional ML model building (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- `sentiment2(models).ipynb`: Deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, embedding layers) and advanced evaluation.

## üß† Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning** using NLTK and regular expressions
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLTK.

## üìä Results

- Achieved up to **85% accuracy** with LSTM-based sentiment classification.
- Extracted insights for product improvement and user preference prediction.
## Applications

Product recommendation engines
Marketing and branding strategies
Review-based product quality assessment
